The course plan is designed to build a strong foundation in computer science and progress students towards advanced topics in the field.

In Term 1, students start with Programming Fundamentals, which serves as the basis for all programming concepts. This course provides essential knowledge and skills that are fundamental to computer science. Discrete Mathematics is included in this term to introduce students to the mathematical foundations that underpin many computer science concepts. Mathematics 1A complements the programming and discrete mathematics courses by providing a broader mathematical background.

Moving on to Term 2, Computer Systems Fundamentals and Software Engineering Fundamentals build upon the programming knowledge acquired in Programming Fundamentals. Data Structures and Algorithms, also in Term 2, is crucial for understanding efficient problem-solving techniques in computer science. These courses expand on the foundational concepts introduced in Term 1 and prepare students for more complex topics.

In Term 3, Object-Oriented Design and Programming require a solid understanding of Software Engineering Fundamentals and Data Structures and Algorithms. This course introduces advanced programming principles and design patterns. The Computer Science Project, which comes after, integrates the knowledge and skills acquired in previous courses into a larger project, providing practical experience in applying computer science concepts. Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology ties in at the end of the program, ensuring students are aware of the ethical and professional responsibilities associated with working in the field.

Overall, the progression of courses from foundational to advanced topics allows students to build a comprehensive understanding of computer science and prepares them for real-world
