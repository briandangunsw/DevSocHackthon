The course plan is designed to build a strong foundation in computer science and progress students towards advanced topics in the field. 

In Term 1, students start with Programming Fundamentals, which is essential for understanding the basics of programming. They also take Discrete Mathematics and Mathematics 1A to develop critical mathematical skills that are fundamental to computer science.

Moving on to Term 2, students delve into more technical subjects with Computer Systems Fundamentals and Software Engineering Fundamentals. These courses require a solid understanding of programming, gained in Programming Fundamentals. Data Structures and Algorithms, another core course in Term 2, also builds on the programming knowledge acquired in Term 1.

Term 3 focuses on advanced topics such as Object-Oriented Design and Programming, which requires knowledge of Software Engineering Fundamentals and Data Structures and Algorithms. This progression ensures that students have the necessary skills to tackle more complex programming concepts. The Computer Science Project allows students to apply their knowledge in a practical setting, further consolidating their understanding.

The final course in Term 3, Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology, builds on the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program, particularly in the Computer Science Project. This course addresses the ethical considerations and professional responsibilities that are essential in the field of information technology.

Overall, the course plan is structured to provide a solid foundation in programming, mathematics, and computer science fundamentals before progressing to more advanced topics. Prerequisites are carefully considered to ensure that students have the necessary background knowledge to succeed in each
