The course plan is designed to progressively build a strong foundation in computer science and software engineering while advancing students into more complex and specialized topics.

In Term 1, students are introduced to Programming Fundamentals, which serves as the gateway to understanding basic programming concepts. Discrete Mathematics and Mathematics 1A complement this by providing the essential mathematical background required for more advanced courses.

In Term 2, students delve deeper into the fundamentals of computer systems through the Computer Systems Fundamentals course, building on the programming skills learned in Programming Fundamentals. Software Engineering Fundamentals and Data Structures and Algorithms further enhance students' understanding of software development processes and algorithms, which are crucial in building efficient and scalable computer programs.

Term 3 focuses on more advanced topics in software development and computer science. Object-Oriented Design and Programming leverages the knowledge gained in Software Engineering Fundamentals and Data Structures and Algorithms to teach students how to design and implement complex software systems using object-oriented principles. The Computer Science Project allows students to apply their skills in a practical project, further enhancing their understanding and experience in software development. Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology wraps up the term by addressing the important ethical considerations that arise in the field of information technology.

Overall, the course plan is structured in a way that ensures students first establish a solid foundation in programming and mathematics before progressing to more advanced topics in software development, computer systems, and professional issues. This sequential approach helps students gradually build their skills and knowledge, preparing them for the challenges of the
