The course plan is structured in a way that ensures a smooth progression from foundational concepts to more advanced topics in computer science.

In the first term (T1), students start with Programming Fundamentals, providing them with the essential programming skills and knowledge. This course serves as a prerequisite for Computer Systems Fundamentals and Software Engineering Fundamentals in the second term (T2). Discrete Mathematics and Mathematics 1A are also included in T1 to establish a solid mathematical foundation that is essential for understanding complex algorithms and data structures in later courses.

In T2, Computer Systems Fundamentals and Software Engineering Fundamentals expand on the programming knowledge gained in the first term and introduce students to the inner workings of computer systems and software development processes. Data Structures and Algorithms, another T2 course, builds upon the programming fundamentals learned in the first term and is crucial for developing efficient and optimized solutions to computational problems.

Moving on to T3, Object-Oriented Design and Programming requires a strong understanding of software engineering fundamentals and data structures and algorithms, making it a fitting course for this term. The Computer Science Project course is also included in T3, drawing on the knowledge acquired in Software Engineering Fundamentals and Data Structures and Algorithms to allow students to apply their skills in a real-world project setting. This course prepares students for the transition to professional work and is further supported by the Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology course.

The progression of courses from foundational programming and mathematics to advanced topics such as software design and project implementation ensures
