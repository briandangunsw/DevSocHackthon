The course plan is structured to provide a solid foundation in computer science concepts and skills in the early terms (T1 and T2) before progressing to more advanced and specialized topics in T3.

In T1, Programming Fundamentals is introduced without any prerequisites to ensure that all students start with a basic understanding of programming. Discrete Mathematics and Mathematics 1A are also fundamental courses that provide the mathematical background necessary for more advanced topics in computer science.

In T2, Computer Systems Fundamentals and Software Engineering Fundamentals build upon the knowledge gained in Programming Fundamentals. Data Structures and Algorithms further strengthens students' programming skills and problem-solving abilities. These courses lay the groundwork for more complex topics in T3.

In T3, Object-Oriented Design and Programming and Computer Science Project delve into more advanced programming concepts and practical application of software engineering principles. These courses require prerequisites from T2 to ensure that students have the necessary foundational knowledge to succeed. Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology rounds out the curriculum by addressing important ethical and social considerations in the field of computer science.

Overall, the course plan is designed to gradually introduce students to key concepts in computer science, build a strong foundation in programming and software engineering, and then progress to more advanced topics while addressing ethical considerations in the field. By following this progression, students can develop a comprehensive understanding of computer science and be well-prepared for future courses and professional opportunities.
