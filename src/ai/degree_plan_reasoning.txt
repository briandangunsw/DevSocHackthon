In the first term, students are introduced to foundational concepts in Programming Fundamentals, which sets the groundwork for understanding programming languages and basic algorithms. Concurrently, they also study Discrete Mathematics, which provides the mathematical foundation necessary for computer science.

Moving on to the second term, students delve deeper into computer systems in Computer Systems Fundamentals, building on their programming knowledge from the previous term. They also learn about Software Engineering Fundamentals, which introduces them to the principles of software development. Complementing these courses, Data Structures and Algorithms further enhance their problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

In the third term, students advance to Object-Oriented Design and Programming, where they apply their knowledge of software engineering and data structures to design and develop complex software systems. The Computer Science Project allows them to work on a real-world project, integrating theories learned in previous courses. Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology concludes the program by addressing the ethical, social, and professional responsibilities of a computer scientist.

The progression of the courses ensures that students build a strong foundation in programming, mathematics, and computer systems before moving on to more advanced topics such as object-oriented design and ethical considerations in information technology. Each course is designed to build upon the knowledge gained in the preceding courses, leading to a well-rounded understanding of computer science principles and practices.
