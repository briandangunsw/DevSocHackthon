In the first term (T1), the focus is on laying down the foundational knowledge required for advanced topics in computer science. Programming Fundamentals introduces students to the basic concepts of programming, which is essential for understanding more complex topics in the field. Discrete Mathematics provides the mathematical background needed for analyzing algorithms and data structures. Mathematics 1A builds on this foundation by introducing calculus concepts that are often used in computer science.

Moving on to the second term (T2), Computer Systems Fundamentals and Software Engineering Fundamentals build upon the programming knowledge gained in Programming Fundamentals. Understanding computer systems is crucial for developing efficient and optimized software, making Computer Systems Fundamentals a key course. Software Engineering Fundamentals introduces students to the principles of software design and development. Data Structures and Algorithms is a core course that is important for understanding how to efficiently manipulate and organize data in software development.

In the third term (T3), students delve into more advanced topics. Object-Oriented Design and Programming builds on the knowledge gained in Software Engineering Fundamentals and Data Structures and Algorithms, focusing on designing and developing object-oriented systems. The Computer Science Project allows students to apply their knowledge in a real-world project, integrating concepts from Software Engineering Fundamentals and Data Structures and Algorithms. Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology is a course that emphasizes the ethical and legal considerations that come with working in the field of information technology, making it a fitting end to the program.

By structuring the courses in this way, students gradually build a
