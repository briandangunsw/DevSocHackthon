Term 1 focuses on establishing a strong foundation in programming, mathematics, and discrete mathematics. Programming Fundamentals introduces students to the basics of programming, which is essential for all future courses. Discrete Mathematics provides students with the necessary mathematical background to understand and analyze algorithms and data structures. Mathematics 1A lays the groundwork for future mathematical concepts that will be encountered in more advanced courses.

In Term 2, the focus shifts to building on the foundation established in Term 1. Computer Systems Fundamentals and Software Engineering Fundamentals utilize the programming skills learned in Programming Fundamentals to delve into the inner workings of computer systems and the principles of software engineering. Data Structures and Algorithms further enhances students' programming skills by introducing them to advanced data structures and algorithms. These courses are essential for understanding how to efficiently solve complex problems in programming.

Term 3 is dedicated to more advanced topics in computer science. Object-Oriented Design and Programming introduces students to the principles of object-oriented programming, which is a fundamental concept in software development. The Computer Science Project allows students to apply their knowledge and skills acquired in previous courses to a real-world project. Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology ensures that students are aware of the ethical considerations and professional responsibilities that come with a career in information technology.

Overall, the course plan is designed to progressively build a solid foundation in programming, mathematics, and computer science principles in Term 1 and Term 2. These foundational skills are then applied and further developed in more advanced topics in Term
