The course plan for the three terms is structured to build a strong foundation in computer science and progress towards advanced topics in software development and computer science principles.

In the first term (T1), students begin with Programming Fundamentals, which serves as the starting point for understanding basic programming concepts and logic. Discrete Mathematics is included to provide students with the mathematical foundation necessary for computer science. Mathematics 1A complements the programming and discrete mathematics courses by introducing fundamental mathematical concepts that are essential in the field of computer science.

Moving into the second term (T2), students advance to Computer Systems Fundamentals, which requires knowledge from Programming Fundamentals to understand the inner workings of computer systems. Software Engineering Fundamentals builds upon the programming knowledge from the first term and introduces students to software development methodologies. Data Structures and Algorithms further enhances students' programming skills by teaching them how to efficiently store and manipulate data.

In the third term (T3), students delve into more advanced topics such as Object-Oriented Design and Programming, which builds upon the software engineering principles learned in the previous term. The Computer Science Project allows students to apply their knowledge in a practical setting, incorporating software engineering fundamentals and data structures and algorithms. Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology ties everything together by exploring the ethical and professional responsibilities within the field of information technology.

The progression of courses ensures that students first establish a solid foundation in programming, mathematics, and computer systems before advancing to more complex topics like software engineering and computer science principles. The prerequisites
