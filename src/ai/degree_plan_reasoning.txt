The course plan is strategically designed to provide a strong foundational knowledge in programming, computer systems, software engineering, and data structures and algorithms before progressing to more advanced topics in object-oriented design and programming, computer science projects, and professional issues and ethics in information technology.

In Term 1, Programming Fundamentals lays the groundwork for students by teaching them basic programming concepts and problem-solving skills. Discrete Mathematics complements this by introducing students to fundamental mathematical concepts that are essential for computer science. Mathematics 1A further strengthens their mathematical skills, preparing them for more advanced mathematical concepts in the future.

Moving to Term 2, Computer Systems Fundamentals and Software Engineering Fundamentals build on the programming foundation established in Term 1. These courses provide students with an understanding of how computer systems function and how to design and develop software efficiently. Data Structures and Algorithms further enhance their problem-solving abilities and algorithmic thinking, which are crucial skills in computer science.

In Term 3, Object-Oriented Design and Programming introduces students to a key programming paradigm used in software development. By this point, students have the necessary background knowledge to delve into more complex topics such as object-oriented design. The Computer Science Project allows students to apply their skills and knowledge in a practical setting, preparing them for real-world projects. Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology rounds out the curriculum by familiarizing students with the ethical considerations and responsibilities that come with working in the field of information technology.

By carefully sequencing the courses in this manner, students are
