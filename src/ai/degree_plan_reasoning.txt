The course plan has been designed to build a strong foundation in computer science and progress into more advanced topics over the three terms.

In Term 1 (T1), Programming Fundamentals is the starting point as it provides essential knowledge and skills in programming. Discrete Mathematics and Mathematics 1A are included to establish a solid mathematical foundation which is crucial for understanding advanced computer science concepts.

In Term 2 (T2), Computer Systems Fundamentals and Software Engineering Fundamentals are introduced to deepen understanding of how computer systems operate and to learn key principles of software development. Data Structures and Algorithms is included to delve into essential data structures and algorithms, which are fundamental in solving complex problems efficiently.

Term 3 (T3) progresses into more advanced topics with Object-Oriented Design and Programming, which builds upon the concepts learned in software engineering and data structures. This course focuses on designing and implementing software systems using object-oriented principles. The Computer Science Project allows students to apply their knowledge in a real-world project, integrating software engineering practices and data structures. Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology rounds off the course plan by addressing the ethical and professional responsibilities that come with working in the field of information technology.

Overall, the course plan is structured to ensure a progressive learning journey, starting with foundational topics and gradually moving into more advanced and specialized areas of computer science. Each course builds upon the knowledge and skills acquired in the previous courses, leading to a comprehensive understanding of key computer science concepts and practices.
