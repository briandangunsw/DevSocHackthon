In the proposed course plan, the foundational courses are introduced in the first term to provide students with essential knowledge and skills in programming, mathematics, and discrete mathematics. 

Programming Fundamentals serves as the starting point, laying down the basic principles of programming which are fundamental for understanding more advanced concepts in computer science. Discrete Mathematics and Mathematics 1A complement the programming skills by introducing the mathematical foundations necessary for analyzing algorithms and data structures.

Moving on to the second term, Computer Systems Fundamentals, Software Engineering Fundamentals, and Data Structures and Algorithms delve deeper into the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. These courses continue to build upon the programming skills acquired in the first term, while also introducing students to the underlying principles of computer systems, software engineering practices, and efficient data structures and algorithms.

In the third term, the focus shifts towards more advanced topics such as Object-Oriented Design and Programming, Computer Science Project, and Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology. Object-Oriented Design and Programming leverages the understanding of software engineering and data structures to teach students how to design and implement complex software systems using object-oriented principles. The Computer Science Project allows students to apply their knowledge and skills in a real-world project, further enhancing their practical experience. Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology rounds out the curriculum by addressing ethical considerations and professional responsibilities within the field of information technology.

By strategically sequencing these courses, students are able to build a strong foundation in programming, mathematics, and computer science fundamentals before progressing
