In the proposed course plan, the progression of courses is structured to provide students with a strong foundation in key areas of computer science and information technology before moving on to more advanced topics. 

In the first term (T1), students start with Programming Fundamentals, which is crucial as it introduces them to the basic concepts of programming. This course serves as the starting point for building the necessary skills to understand more complex topics later on.

Alongside Programming Fundamentals, students also take Discrete Mathematics and Mathematics 1A. Discrete Mathematics is essential for developing problem-solving skills and understanding the theoretical aspects of computer science. Mathematics 1A provides a solid mathematical foundation that will be important for courses like Data Structures and Algorithms in the following term.

Moving on to the second term (T2), students delve into Computer Systems Fundamentals, Software Engineering Fundamentals, and Data Structures and Algorithms. Computer Systems Fundamentals, which builds upon Programming Fundamentals, introduces students to the inner workings of computer systems. Software Engineering Fundamentals expands on programming concepts to incorporate the process of designing and building software systems. Data Structures and Algorithms, which builds upon Programming Fundamentals and Mathematics 1A, is essential for understanding efficient algorithms and data organization.

In the third term (T3), students progress to Object-Oriented Design and Programming, Computer Science Project, and Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology. Object-Oriented Design and Programming, which builds upon Software Engineering Fundamentals and Data Structures and Algorithms, reinforces key
